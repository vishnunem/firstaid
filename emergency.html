	<h3>First aid in case of a sudden heart attack</h3>

	<h4>Dos:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><h5>Call emergency services:</h5> Dial the emergency number (e.g., 911) immediately to get professional help on the way.</li>
		<li><h5>Stay calm:</h5> Help the person sit down and try to keep them calm.</li>
		<li><h5>Loosen clothing:</h5> If possible, loosen any tight clothing around the person’s neck or chest.</li>
		<li><h5>Assist with medication:</h5> If the person has prescribed chest pain medication (e.g., nitroglycerin), help them take it as directed.</li>
		<li><h5>Use an automated external defibrillator (AED):</h5> If available, follow the instructions on the AED to provide potentially life-saving treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Don’ts:</h4>
	<ul>

		<li><h5>Drive or take public transport to the hospital:</h5> It is safer to wait for an ambulance, as the person’s condition may deteriorate en route.</li>
		<li><h5>Ignore the pain:</h5> Take any chest pain or discomfort seriously and seek immediate medical attention2.
		<li><h5>Get anxious about time wasted:</h5> Trust that the paramedics will perform necessary tests and procedures to assess the situation</li><br>
	</ul>

	<h3>First aid in case of a sudden cardiac arrest</h3>
		
	<h4>Dos:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Call 911 immediately to get emergency care quickly.</li>
		<li>If more than one person is available, one should call 911 while the other tends to the person whose heart has stopped.</li>
		<li>Start CPR immediately.</li>
		<li> The American Heart Association recommends doing CPR with hard and fast chest compressions.
		<ol>
			<li> Push hard and fast on the person’s chest — about 100 to 120 pushes a minute.</li>
			<li> If you’ve been trained in CPR, check the person’s airway.</li>
			<li>Then deliver rescue breaths after every 30 compressions.</li>
			<li>If you haven’t been trained, just continue chest compressions.</li> 
			<li>Allow the chest to rise completely between compressions.</li>
			<li>Use an automated external defibrillator (AED) if one is available.</li>
			<li>Portable AEDs are available in many public places, including airports and shopping malls. </li>
			<li>They come with step-by-step voice instructions for their use and are programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate.</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>

<h4>Don’ts:</h4>
	<ul>

		<li>Don’t wait for EMS to arrive.</li>
		<li> Seconds matter. Start CPR immediately.
		<li>Don’t wait for someone else to step in. Start CPR even if it is not perfect.</li>
		<li>Doing CPR gives the person their best chance.</li>
	</ul>
Remember, sudden cardiac arrest is a serious and life-threatening medical emergency. <br>Immediate action with CPR and an AED can make a significant difference in saving a life<br><br><br>
